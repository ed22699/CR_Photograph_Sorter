# CR-Photograph-Sorter
## Current Workflow
1. Create new folder in the camera for each race/division/category (4-50 boats)
2. Folders with the RAW images are then imported onto a laptop/exteranl SSD (usually import every couple of categories/races)
3. Folders imported into Adobe Lightroom. All images from all the folders appear at once, but remian sorted in their forlers
4. All images are edited and then exported back to their respective folders in JPG format (RAWs also remian in those folders)
5. Edited JPGs only are uploaded to pre-made corresponding folders on our cloud based photo sales platform Zenfolio
