## Plan
1. User selects sport and the relevant tags
2. Look through photos, tag metadata and read all that we can and mark as read
3. Extrapolate other photos data from those identified
4. Ask user about any photos that could not be identified or could be either or
5. User decides what new folder structure he wants based off these new metadata tags
6. Click confirm and folders will be reorganised on the desktop, and the metadata tags removed?
